      "EE 590 Homework 1 -- QR Decompositions\n",
      "======================================\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of this homework is to explore the QR decomposition of matricies, with particular attention paid to linear algebraic and numerical stability.  I will implement the algorithm request in Julia, MATLAB, and Python, comparing the three for readability/ease of use and speed.  First, let's go over some theory:\n",

      "Theory of QR decomposition\n",
      "--------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The QR decomposition is defined by the following equivalence:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\n",
      "A = Q R\n",
      "$$\n",
      "Where $Q$ is orthonormal, $R$ is upper triangular, and\n",
      "$$\n",
      "A \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n \\times m}, \\quad\n",
      "Q \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n \\times n}, \\quad\n",
      "R \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n \\times m}\n",
      "$$\n",
      "\n",
      "This decomposition can be seen as the decomposition of $A$ onto a set of orthonormal basis vectors.  The residual of the decomposition serves as the weights required upon each basis vector in order to reconstruct each column of $A$.  The matrices $Q$ and $R$ therefore represent the orthonormal basis vector set and the residual weights set, respectively.  In order to ensure the triangular nature of $R$, it is therefore necessary to represent the first column of $A$ as a linear combination of only one basis vector, the second column of $A$ as a linear combination of only two basis vectors, and so on.  We therefore construct an orthonormal set spanning $A$ by taking the first column of $A$ as our first basis vector:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\n",
      "v_1 = A_{1} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad u_1 = \\frac{v_1}{\\|v_1\\|}\n",
      "$$\n",
      "\n",
      "The second column of $A$ can therefore be expressed as a linear combination of this first basis vector $u_1$ and whatever component is necessary to move along the orthogonal direction from $u_1$ to $A_2$:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\n",
      "v_2 = A_{2} - \\frac{\\langle A_{2},u_1 \\rangle}{\\langle u_1,u_1 \\rangle} u_1 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad u_2 = \\frac{v_2}{\\|v_2\\|}\n",
      "$$\n",
      "\n",
      "...and so on for further columns. This therefore gives closed-form expressions for the first two orthonormal basis vectors, which represent the first two columns of $Q$.  Expressing the first column of $A$ in terms of these two basis vectors is trivial:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\n",
      "A_{1} = \\langle A_{1}, u_1 \\rangle u_1\n",
      "$$\n",
      "\n",
      "The second column of $A$ is similarly straightforward:\n",
      "$$\n",
      "A_{2} = \\langle A_{2}, u_1 \\rangle u_1 + \\langle A_{2}, u_2 \\rangle u_2\n",
      "$$\n",
      "\n",
      "We can see the evident pattern, giving us the general closed-form solution for any column $A_{j}$:\n",
      "$$\n",
      "A_{j} = \\sum_i^j \\langle A_{j}, u_i \\rangle u_i\n",
      "$$\n",
      "\n",
      "This therefore yields a triangular structure on $R$, as the projection terms are the entries of the $R$ matrix.  The columns of the $Q$ matrix are orthogonal and normal by construction, therefore $Q$ and $R$ satisfy all requirements on them."
